//   table is resized, number of segments doubles up, to a maximum of max_segments.
// - add_range is the number of buckets searched in order to find a free bucket for
//   displacement closer to base bucket.  When no free buckets within  add_range of

//   uint32_t is sufficient. the size of hop_range may have performance implications.
